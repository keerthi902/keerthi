1.How many total combinations are possible? Show the math along with the code!

2.Calculate and display the distribution of all possible combinations that can be
obtained when rolling both Die A and Die B together. Show the math along with
the code!
Hint: A 6 x 6 Matrix.

3.Calculate the Probability of all Possible Sums occurring among the number of
combinations from (2).
Example: P(Sum = 2) = 1/X as there is only one combination possible to obtain
Sum = 2. Die A = Die B = 1

4.But in order to play your game, the probability of obtaining the Sums must remain the
same!
So if you could only roll P(Sum = 2) = 1/X, the new dice must have the spots reattached
such that those probabilities are not changed.
Input:
● Die_A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] & Die B = Die_A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output:
● A Transform Function undoom_dice that takes (Die_A, Die_B) as input &
outputs New_Die_A = [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?],New_Die_B = [?, ?,
?, ?, ?, ?] where,
● No New_Die A[x] > 4
